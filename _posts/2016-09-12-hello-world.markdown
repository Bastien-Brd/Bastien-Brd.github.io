Hello and welcome!

My name is Bastien Bourdon and this is the first post on my personal website. Its main purpose will be mostly to write for myself: I find writing an article about a subject one is working on helps a lot with completing a specific goal or milestone within that project and forces good structure and communication.

I will write mostly about tech (web development, dev ops, data science), my experience as a startup co-founder and entrepreneur in general, and possibly any other subject or idea that piques my interest.

Here is a sample of python code to try out the beautiful code highlighting you might encounter throughout my posts:

``` python
def say_hello(greetings="Bonjour!"):
  print(greetings)
  return "User has been greeted."
```

While you wait for more progress on my writing, check out my startup's website: [edgefolio.com](https://edgefolio.com). Do not hesitate contacting me for any reason.

Cheers!
